### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析框架来研究AI系统在有限时间内能力无限增长的条件，通过物理和信息论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型区分超线性和亚临界状态，并开发可部署的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量条件下会出现能力无限增长的"失控增长"现象，以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可测试的条件取代猜测。

Method: 开发递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，利用功率、带宽和内存等物理和信息论限制定义服务边界，建立资本与计算、数据和能源耦合的内生增长模型。

Result: 推导出将可观测序列映射为失控与非奇异行为证书的决策规则，提供基于功率上限、吞吐量节流和评估门等可直接实施的安全控制措施，并通过分析案例研究说明边界约束何时生效。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试条件和可部署控制措施取代了对AI奇点的猜测，为认证或排除AI奇点提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型数据归因方法需要大量计算资源，使得在实际应用中不实用，需要开发更高效的归因方法。

Method: 将基于反学习的慢速归因方法提炼到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索方法，无需运行昂贵的归因算法即可找到高度影响的训练图像。

Result: 在MSCOCO训练的中等规模模型和LAION训练的大规模Stable Diffusion模型上进行了广泛测试，证明该方法能在几秒内实现更好或竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上大规模应用数据归因方法的重要一步。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线困难、并发症影响质量和结果的问题，需要数据驱动的工具来减少变异性、优化培训和改善手术表现。

Method: 通过德尔菲法达成对通用工作流程描述符的共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并在多中心腹腔镜和机器人结直肠手术视频数据集上进行应用和验证。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评分者间信度中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为微创结直肠手术提供了首个基于共识的验证视频评估工具，可标准化培训、加速能力获取并推动数据驱动的外科质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Motivation: 现有的基于LRP的剪枝方法虽然不需要微调，适合数据有限场景，但仍然存在显著的精度下降问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用可解释AI技术Layer-wise Relevance Propagation(LRP)进行模型剪枝，针对有限计算资源环境优化预训练模型。

Result: 提出的方法在少量数据情况下实现了比现有方法更高的剪枝率，同时更好地保持了模型精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为在有限数据环境下进行高效模型压缩提供了可行的解决方案，在保持精度的同时实现了更高的剪枝率。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting. A video projector (V-JEPA Vision Transformer) associated to a lightweight probabilistic head is attached to a pre-trained satellite vision encoder (DINOv3\text{-}SAT493M) to map encoder tokens into a discrete empirical CDF (eCDF) over 4-hour accumulated rainfall.

*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一个新颖的阶段窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的可信区域归因，以近线性复杂度实现了接近贪婪选择的效果，显著减少了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子模子集选择的方法虽然实现了高可信度，但计算效率低限制了在实际场景中的部署，需要更高效的归因方法。

Method: 采用分阶段粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪婪选择。

Result: PhaseWin仅使用20%的计算预算就达到了贪婪归因95%以上的可信度，在物体检测和视觉定位任务中持续优于其他归因基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高可信度归因的新技术标准，在保持理论保证的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [8] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的负提示方法包含广泛的非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致次优结果。需要改进负提示以更好地捕捉类别间特征。

Method: 使用LLM初始化类别特定的正负提示，然后优化这些提示——正提示关注类内特征，负提示突出类别边界特征。采用基于图的架构聚合语义感知监督并传播到视觉分支。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K两个基准测试中，针对8个OOD数据集和5种不同LLM的广泛实验表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递，有效提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n两个轻量级模型在面部表情识别任务中的性能，发现在干净数据集上YOLOv12n表现更优，而在噪声数据上YOLOv11n具有更高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非约束真实环境中，面部表情识别仍然具有挑战性，需要平衡性能和效率的轻量级模型。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型，通过mAP 0.5、精确率、召回率和混淆矩阵评估性能。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净KDEF数据集上达到最高mAP 0.5为95.6，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精确率为65.2，假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡性能与效率，在敏感性和精确度间存在权衡，适合实时资源受限的情感AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的新框架，用于解决异构架构（如ViT到ResNet18）知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合教师和学生的互补特征，在共享logits中对齐表示，并引入子logit解耦蒸馏和正交性损失来促进多样化的知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统同构KD方法难以有效解决这一问题。现有的异构KD方法要么计算成本高、设计复杂，要么过度依赖logit对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: 提出HCD框架：1）通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征；2）与教师倒数第二层特征拼接后通过CFM模块映射生成共享logits；3）引入子logit解耦蒸馏（SDD）将共享logits划分为n个子logits；4）提出正交性损失（OL）确保子logit多样性并减少冗余知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为异构知识蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

*Xingyue Zhao,Wenke Huang,Xingguang Wang,Haoyu Zhao,Linghao Zhuang,Anwen Jiang,Guancheng Wan,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FedBCS方法，通过领域不变上下文原型对齐来解决联邦学习中的特征异构性问题，特别关注多级上下文表示学习和层间风格偏差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中由于不同扫描仪或协议导致的特征异构性是主要挑战，现有方法存在两个关键局限：1) 不完整的上下文表示学习，主要关注最终层特征而忽略多级线索；2) 层间风格偏差累积，忽视中间层的领域特定偏差。

Method: 提出FedBCS方法，包括频率域自适应风格重新校准的原型构建，以及上下文感知的双级原型对齐方法，从编码器和解码器的不同层提取领域不变原型并与上下文信息融合。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出显著的性能。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异构性问题，提高了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM是一个用于微表情识别的多模态大语言模型，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐，解决了静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情绪至关重要。现有方法存在两个核心挑战：静态外观与动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；现有MER数据集的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，造成文本监督与物理运动之间的语义差距。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐。首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应关系。然后设计包含三个专家的架构，将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的MER基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特殊优势。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过将Uni-MER的指令对齐知识整合到模型中，为微表情注入了有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，从而能够精确捕捉细微的情感线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

TL;DR: ERMoE是一种稀疏MoE架构，通过将专家重新参数化到学习正交特征基中，用特征基评分替代学习门控逻辑，实现稳定路由和可解释专家专业化，无需显式负载均衡损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不对齐导致的路由不稳定、专家利用率低，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化到学习的正交特征基中，用输入特征与专家基之间的余弦相似度作为特征基评分来替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由。

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准上达到最先进精度，自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布；3D MRI变体将脑年龄预测精度提高7%以上，并产生解剖学可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定问题，实现可扩展、可解释的专业化性能提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC是一个两阶段框架，用于CLIP模型的类增量学习，通过解耦视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化来缓解分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT是其增强版本，引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的优化有效缓解了分类器偏差，DMC-OT通过最优传输校准进一步提升了性能，为CLIP模型的类增量学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过多相位聚合平滑时间核，解决视频LLMs中的时间不一致性问题，无需训练即可提升模型对微小时间偏移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会导致注意力翻转并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于多模态RoPE扩展导致的逆傅里叶时间核中的帧级波纹。

Method: 提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)，一种无需训练的机制，通过在不同注意力头应用相反相位偏移并聚合输出，平滑时间核并降低相位敏感性，同时保持位置编码结构不变。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在相同token预算下显示出持续改进，计算开销可忽略不计。PAS为视频LLMs提供了即插即用的鲁棒时间编码升级方案。

Conclusion: PAS通过多相位聚合有效平滑了时间核，提高了视频LLMs对时间偏移的鲁棒性，同时保持了每个头的频谱幅度，为视频理解任务提供了稳定的时间编码解决方案。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流程，用于零样本视觉任务。该方法通过量化和二值化两个步骤，将开放式查询转换为多项选择题，再进一步转化为真/假验证问题，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中表现不佳，特别是处理开放式查询时。作者旨在设计一种无需额外训练的统一工作流程，通过改进推理过程来提升模型性能。

Method: 工作流程包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放式查询转换为具有明确候选列表的多项选择题；(2) 二值化：为每个候选生成真/假问题，通过确定性规则进行解析。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，该方法相比直接回答开放式查询获得了显著提升。量化到多项选择题带来了大幅增益，而真/假二值化提供了额外的一致改进。

Conclusion: 该工作流程提供了一种简单统一的方法，强调推理时设计而非任务特定训练，为当前视觉语言模型提供了实用的零样本视觉增强路径。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的生成模型框架，通过固定格式提示实现多样性和稳定性生成，无需额外数据，在医学图像生成中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像合成模型在专业领域（如医学）中面临的数据类型有限和数据量不足的问题，实现多样生成的同时保持稳定性。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，使用Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层和Kullback-Leibler散度实现连续特征表示。

Result: 在耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的模型F1分数达83.21%，合成与真实数据结合时F1分数达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用中有效的数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

TL;DR: 提出PROMISE框架，通过提示学习和分层对比学习解决多模态数据中模态缺失时的表示一致性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在真实场景中遇到模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要原因是完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致

Method: PROMISE将多模态提示学习融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门的提示注意力机制，动态生成缺失模态下的鲁棒表示

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和消融研究显示，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能

Conclusion: PROMISE通过创新的提示注意力机制有效弥合完整与不完整数据之间的表示差距，提升了模态缺失场景下的多模态表示鲁棒性

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个专为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画贴纸，每段视频都有情感标签、视觉属性和文本标注。基于该数据集开发了情感条件视频生成技术，显著提升了文本到视频和图像到视频任务的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽略情感维度，视频社区缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实情境下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，通过系统分析揭示视觉特征与情感感知的空间和时间模式，基于这些洞察对Wan2.1模型进行微调，开发情感条件视频生成技术。

Result: 在定量指标和生成视频的视觉质量方面都显示出显著改进，为情感视频计算建立了新基准。

Conclusion: EmoVid不仅为艺术风格视频中的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了Draft and Refine (DnR)框架，通过问题条件化的利用率指标量化LVLMs对视觉证据的依赖程度，并利用外部视觉专家反馈来增强视觉基础，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型过度依赖语言先验而非视觉证据，产生不接地气或幻觉的响应，缺乏量化衡量模型在推理过程中实际使用视觉信息的方法。

Method: DnR框架包含问题条件化利用率指标和精炼过程。该指标通过构建查询条件化相关性图来定位问题特定线索，并通过相关性引导的概率掩码测量依赖程度。DnR智能体利用外部视觉专家的反馈来精炼初始草稿，将专家输出渲染为视觉线索，选择能最大程度提高利用率的响应。

Result: 在VQA和图像描述基准测试中，实验显示准确率持续提升，幻觉现象减少。

Conclusion: 测量视觉利用率为构建更可解释和证据驱动的多模态智能体系统提供了原则性路径，无需重新训练或架构改变即可增强视觉基础。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在"视觉处理瓶颈"，容易失去视觉证据的锚定，在长时间生成过程中缺乏情境化的视觉体验。

Method: 受人类认知记忆理论启发，提出VisMem框架，包含动态潜在视觉记忆：短期模块用于细粒度感知保留，长期模块用于抽象语义整合，在推理过程中无缝调用这些记忆。

Result: 在多样化的视觉理解、推理和生成基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一种新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种用于扩散文本到图像模型的安全生成方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，仅针对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，在提高安全性的同时最小化对内容的意外修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性（无法根据提示词调整引导强度）和选择性（无法仅针对图像中的不安全区域），这限制了它们在防止有害内容生成方面的有效性。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，仅对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，而不是对整个图像施加统一的引导强度。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最大限度地减少了意外内容修改。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Motivation: 解决U-Net变体在逆问题中信息丢失的问题，特别是难以恢复精细高频细节的局限性

Method: 基于小波完美重构特性，选择性抑制冗余特征，设计即插即用的SUPER解码器块，消除U-Net变体的重构瓶颈

Result: 在裂缝分割任务中显著提升细裂缝（<4像素）的分割性能；在图像去噪任务中PSNR有适度提升；计算成本相当但表征多样性更丰富

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用通用性，能在统一的重构感知框架内实现高频保真度和全局一致性

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估基准的空白，揭示了当前MLLMs在复杂协作场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别模型未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验来提高准确性，且依赖单焦距信息导致胚胎表示不完整，容易在细胞遮挡下产生特征模糊。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：1）训练冻结帧级编码器提取鲁棒多焦距特征；2）引入多焦距特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示，设计混合语义边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到最先进结果，单个去噪步骤即可获得最佳平均测试性能，准确率分别为82.8%和81.3%。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦距特征融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类准确性。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存（HGC）方法，通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来降低可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时的计算效率低下问题，因为这类模型需要同时处理控制条件和生成内容，导致计算需求大、效率低。

Method: 采用两种缓存策略：(1) 粗粒度缓存（块级）- 基于特征重用，在模型推理的每一步中动态绕过编码器-解码器块中的冗余计算；(2) 细粒度缓存（提示级）- 在模块内部重用跨注意力图，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本（MACs）显著降低了63%（从18.22T降至6.70T），同时语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法能够有效平衡生成效率和视觉质量，为可控生成模型提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。多模态LLM在组合泛化方面表现优异，传统模型提升有限。

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台，多模态LLM在组合泛化方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: LiteAttention通过利用扩散注意力的时序一致性，有效解决了动态和静态稀疏方法之间的权衡问题，为视频扩散模型提供了高效且质量保持的加速方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成模型已在包括3D数据在内的多种数据模态中得到广泛应用，但对于哪种模型最适合特定任务尚未达成共识。此外，文本和图像等条件信息常被用于引导生成过程，但部分3D数据等条件信息尚未得到充分评估。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间下表现最佳，而自回归模型在离散潜在空间下也能取得竞争性性能，为不同场景下的3D生成任务提供了有价值的模型选择指导。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD)框架和Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO)方法，旨在激发和利用多模态大语言模型中的内部知识推理能力，解决KBVQA任务中推理过程不明确的问题。

Motivation: 现有的KBVQA方法要么通过上下文学习利用MLLMs中的隐式知识，要么通过检索增强生成利用显式知识，但它们的推理过程仍然是隐式的，缺乏从MLLMs中明确的推理轨迹。

Method: 首先通过提示冻结的7B大小MLLM完成问题与真实答案之间的推理过程，构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；然后自蒸馏为Chain-of-Thought生成器和知识生成器；最后使用KEPO优化知识生成器，优先选择置信度低但有用的知识。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，通过明确的推理轨迹和优化的知识选择机制，在KBVQA任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Result: 在三个高分辨率数据集的四个翻译任务中，OT-ALD相比最佳基线模型平均采样效率提升20.29%，FID分数降低2.6。

Conclusion: OT-ALD有效消除了潜在分布不匹配，在提高翻译效率的同时保持了图像质量，为图像到图像翻译提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，能够区分不同类型的异常而无需为每个对象类别训练单独模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法通常只能识别异常但无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独模型，成本高昂。识别异常类型对于准确诊断和成本节约决策至关重要。

Method: 使用仅图像级标签来学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型。作为单一统一框架，能够跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上评估，结果与最先进复杂模型竞争，同时显著减少参数负载和推理时间。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD是一个高度实用且可行的解决方案，特别适用于计算资源受限的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时间不同步，这会降低4D高斯泼溅等动态场景重建方法的质量。

Method: 采用粗到精的对齐模块，首先确定粗略的帧级偏移，然后细化到亚帧精度，可轻松集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时间错位视频，并显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的时间对齐策略增强了4DGS在处理异步数据时的鲁棒性，为实际应用中的非同步多视角视频重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间模型和视觉定位增强，在保持高效推理的同时提升了细粒度视觉语言理解能力，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小规模输入变化下的可靠性仍未得到充分理解。

Method: 通过像素级偏移、几何变换、填充缩放、改写和多语言重写等不改变语义的扰动，在多个模型和数据集上进行系统性评估。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，大量样本在至少一种视觉或文本修改下改变预测答案；样本稳定性是正确性的强指标，稳定样本更可能被正确回答。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: GSD框架有效解决了3D高斯溅射在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，通过利用视频扩散模型的多视图一致性先验，实现了更好的3D场景表示性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Result: 实验表明位置偏见在多模态模型中普遍存在，但不同模态表现不同：文本编码器偏向输入开头，图像编码器在开头和结尾都表现出偏见。这种偏见由位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性等多因素共同导致。

Conclusion: 多模态模型中存在显著的位置偏见问题，且在不同模态中表现各异。理解这些偏见的成因对于开发更公平、更准确的多模态模型至关重要。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Result: DiT-Gaze在感知质量和重定向准确性方面均达到新的最先进水平，将最先进的视线误差降低了4.1%至6.353度。

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze为创建合成训练数据提供了一种优越的方法，其代码和模型将向研究社区开放用于基准测试。

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，联合建模领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，通过领域引导空间路由和熵控制动态分配实现跨域3D点云理解，在多个基准测试中达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D深度学习在多域泛化中的限制，现有数据集规模有限且多源点云异质性高，不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多域融合时出现负迁移问题。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应建模多样领域分布，同时保持跨域几何和结构先验以及全局一致性。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在理解真实世界3D空间智能方面存在根本性困难，源于输入阶段的几何感知编码器计算成本高昂与2D特征浅层化冲突，以及输出阶段离散分词器无法产生精确连续数值的对齐问题。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐显式3D数据与2D视觉特征，并将空间思维链逻辑蒸馏为可注入的推理令牌；直接回归头（DRH）采用"嵌入即值"范式，将专门控制令牌路由到轻量级MLP进行精确连续回归。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双瓶颈解决方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型的3D空间理解能力，证明了模块化设计的有效性。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: 通过标记分组方法可以显著提高视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，且发现的标记组与真实世界中的可接地信息高度一致。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法正确遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现模型内部已经编码了数字正确性的潜在概念。

Method: 基于模型内部对自身计数准确性的隐含意识，提出CountSteer方法，在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明CountSteer将对象计数准确率提高了约4%，同时保持了视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成提供了简单有效的步骤。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: 使用控制生成的平衡合成数据进行微调可以有效解决传统微调过程中的偏见和分布不平衡问题，并能显著提升模型在真实世界数据上的性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

TL;DR: DocSLM是一个高效的小型视觉语言模型，专为资源受限的边缘设备上的长文档理解而设计，通过分层多模态压缩器和流式弃权机制，在减少82%视觉标记、75%参数和71%延迟的同时，在多模态文档基准测试中达到或超越最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在长复杂文档上表现出强大的多模态推理能力，但高内存占用使其难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: DocSLM采用分层多模态压缩器联合编码每页的视觉、文本和布局信息为固定长度序列，并引入流式弃权机制通过基于熵的不确定性校准器顺序处理文档片段并过滤低置信度响应。

Result: 在多个长多模态文档基准测试中，DocSLM使用82%更少的视觉标记、75%更少的参数和71%更低的延迟，达到或超越最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: DocSLM能够在轻量级边缘设备上提供可靠的多模态文档理解，解决了大型模型在资源受限环境中的部署难题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

*Pavel Rojtberg,Julius Kühn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD是一个用于6DoF物体姿态估计的标准分辨率事件相机合成数据集，包含50,000个事件序列，采用物理渲染和线性相机运动模拟生成，并通过系统评估确定了最佳的事件表示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件视觉领域缺乏与帧基计算机视觉相媲美的综合性合成数据资源的问题，为6DoF物体姿态估计提供高质量的事件相机数据集。

Method: 基于物理渲染(PBR)场景和BOP方法学，使用模拟线性相机运动生成事件序列，系统评估不同事件表示方法(时间表面、衰减方式、极性编码)对CNN推理性能的影响。

Result: 发现线性衰减的时间表面和双通道极性编码在姿态估计性能上表现最优，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案，极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: YCB-Ev SD数据集填补了事件视觉领域合成数据的空白，提供了结构化格式的原始事件流和预计算的最优表示，便于直接研究和可重复基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列学习3D一致性的潜在空间，实现与3D监督方法相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这主要是由于精确的3D监督使模型过度拟合固定坐标模式，而非学习必要的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并采用无3D监督的正则化目标（视角一致性、方向连贯性、物理合理性）进行训练。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练的Free3D能够生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能与完全3D监督方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能够促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合隐马尔可夫随机场(HMRF)理论和CNN分割的方法，实现无监督学习和快速分割，并在PU泡沫结构的μCT图像数据集上验证了高分割精度，同时提出了减少标注数据需求的预训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从图像中提取数字材料表示是定量分析材料特性的必要前提。现有分割方法要么缺乏准确性，要么速度慢。虽然监督CNN在分割任务中表现出色，但需要大量标注数据；而无监督方法虽然不需要标注数据，但分割时间长且精度较差。

Method: 集成HMRF理论和CNN分割，结合了两者的优势：无监督学习和快速分割时间。研究了不同邻域项和组件对无监督HMRF损失的贡献，提出了HMRF-UNet模型。

Result: 在PU泡沫结构的μCT图像数据集上，HMRF-UNet实现了无需真实标注的高分割精度。提出的预训练策略显著减少了训练分割模型所需的标注数据量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将HMRF理论与CNN分割相结合，实现了无监督学习和快速分割的平衡，为材料图像分割提供了一种有效的解决方案，同时通过预训练策略降低了标注数据需求。

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出LSEF框架，基于低秩稀疏原理，通过分层建模情感基线和瞬时波动来解决视频情感计算中的模型不稳定和表示退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临复杂情感动态导致的模型不稳定和表示退化问题，核心限制是缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感组件（情感基线和瞬时波动）。

Method: 提出LSEF框架，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块（SEM）捕获低秩情感基线，动态解耦模块（DDM）分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性集成模块（CIM）重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，并采用秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑度和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态判别能力，验证了分层低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态方面的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: LSEF框架通过分层低秩稀疏建模有效解决了视频情感计算中的稳定性问题，为理解情感动态提供了新的理论框架和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

TL;DR: Q-Doc是一个三层评估框架，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估任务中的能力，包括粗粒度质量评分、中粒度失真类型识别和细粒度失真严重程度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未被充分探索，需要建立一个系统性的评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度（质量评分）、中粒度（失真类型识别）、细粒度（失真严重程度评估），并使用思维链提示来提升性能。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具有初步的DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判等关键限制，思维链提示能显著提升所有层级的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准测试，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了有前景的改进途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个用于类增量学习的新框架，通过仅适配CLIP的跨模态桥接层，无需额外参数即可实现稳定知识积累，并利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP在类增量学习中面临的两个挑战：(1) 适配下游任务需要额外模块导致模型复杂和易遗忘；(2) 现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的互补优势。

Method: 提出BOFA框架：仅适配CLIP的跨模态桥接层，使用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新约束到与过去任务特征正交的低秩安全子空间，并采用跨模态混合原型结合稳定文本原型和视觉特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更高的准确率和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA通过桥接层正交融合有效解决了CLIP在类增量学习中的适应性和遗忘问题，无需数据回放即可实现稳定知识积累。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，重点关注多模态标志性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。作者提出了一个评估框架，将识别（模型是否识别引用）与实现（如何通过复制或重新解释来描绘引用）分开量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，特别是文化共享关联的多模态标志性现象，探索模型在识别文化引用和再现它们之间的平衡。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别和实现两个维度，评估了五个扩散模型在767个维基数据文化引用上的表现，包括静态和动态图像。通过提示扰动实验测试语言敏感性，使用同义词替换和字面图像描述。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换。模型即使文本线索改变也经常再现标志性视觉结构。文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于它们复制的内容，还在于它们如何转换和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，走向更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Method: 构建包含100K交错样本的WEAVE-100k数据集和基于480张图像100个任务的WEAVEBench基准，采用混合VLM评估框架。

Result: 在WEAVE-100k上训练能够提升视觉理解、图像编辑和理解-生成协作能力，促进统一多模态模型发展出新兴的视觉记忆能力。

Conclusion: WEAVE为研究上下文交错理解和生成提供了视角和基础，揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑中的持续挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在对象幻觉问题，研究发现模型在产生幻觉预测时往往忽略图像而依赖先前生成的标记来推断新对象。

Method: 引入Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，基于对prelim标记的注意力权重计算，这是一个轻量级、无需训练的信号，可在推理过程中实时计算。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的对象幻觉检测性能，支持实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: 通过利用先前被忽视的prelim注意力信号，PAS能有效检测LVLM中的对象幻觉，提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个基于大脑皮层层次结构的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按视觉皮层层次分组并转化为多尺度皮层金字塔，在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示，实现了高效且可解释的脑活动图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器直接使用fMRI特征而不分析视觉信息在皮层中的组织方式，忽略了大脑的层次处理结构，模糊了早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的作用。

Method: 使用ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔；通过轻量级深度匹配的ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集上的实验表明，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 基于皮层层次结构构建条件是一种强大的替代纯数据驱动嵌入的方法，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试没有系统评估MLLM解释视觉提示（如边界框）的能力，无法确定模型是否能有效识别这种直观的人类提示方法并用于解决问题。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k可视化提示，涵盖8种形状和355种属性组合；第二阶段研究视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLM模型（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3、Qwen2.5-VL等），提供了影响视觉提示理解因素的综合分析，如属性变化、问题安排和模型规模。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLM如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的参考问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Result: 在未见数据集上实现了最先进的零样本性能，在熟悉概念上表现出色，同时能够泛化到相关的未见类别，展示了强大的跨模态迁移能力和对语言变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VoxTell为医学图像分割提供了一种灵活且强大的文本驱动方法，能够处理真实世界的临床文本并实现准确的实例特定分割。

Abstract: We introduce VoxTell, a vision-language model for text-prompted volumetric medical image segmentation. It maps free-form descriptions, from single words to full clinical sentences, to 3D masks. Trained on 62K+ CT, MRI, and PET volumes spanning over 1K anatomical and pathological classes, VoxTell uses multi-stage vision-language fusion across decoder layers to align textual and visual features at multiple scales. It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes. Extensive experiments further demonstrate strong cross-modality transfer, robustness to linguistic variations and clinical language, as well as accurate instance-specific segmentation from real-world text.

*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MaMOL的框架，用于处理遥感多模态分类中的模态缺失问题，通过双路由机制实现参数高效的自适应学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致的模态缺失问题，现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时数据完整，限制了在实际不完整场景下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出缺失感知的LoRA混合框架，将模态缺失重新表述为多任务学习问题，引入任务导向的动态路由器和模态特定共享的静态路由器双路由机制，通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，在不同缺失率下都能保持良好性能，计算开销最小。在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL为不完整多模态学习提供了一个通用且高效的解决方案，具有参数高效、计算开销小和跨领域适用等优势。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Roman Kinakh,Gonzalo R. Ríos-Muñoz,Arrate Muñoz-Barrutia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织学图像推断PD-L1表达，提供准确分割和认知不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组化的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要更高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建，在循环训练期间采样不同模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差实现不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数0.805，平均IoU 0.709，性能与基线方法相当，并提供像素级不确定性图谱。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

### [84] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向注意力层来对齐视觉和文本隐藏状态，在保持编码器效率的同时提升多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态本身已包含丰富结构信息，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的融合方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部添加少量仅跨模态的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间进行跨模态注意力计算，通过门控残差更新返回，并加入简单稳定器改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种高效的多模态融合方法，通过轻量级跨模态对齐模块实现了性能提升，同时保持编码器的非因果性和生成任务的解耦。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

*Felix George,Harshit Kumar,Divya Pathak,Kaustabha Ray,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构和语义分析的无监督循环检测框架，用于检测LLM驱动的智能应用中的隐藏执行循环，显著优于单独使用结构或语义方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的智能应用存在非确定性行为，可能形成隐藏的执行循环，静默消耗资源而不触发显式错误，传统可观测性平台无法检测这些代价高昂的低效问题。

Method: 采用混合方法：首先应用计算高效的时间调用栈分析识别显式循环，然后利用语义相似性分析发现以冗余内容生成为特征的微妙循环。

Result: 在基于LangGraph的股票市场应用的1575条轨迹上评估，混合方法F1得分为0.72（精确率0.62，召回率0.86），显著优于单独的结构方法（F1: 0.08）和语义方法（F1: 0.28）。

Conclusion: 虽然结果令人鼓舞，但仍有很大改进空间，未来工作需要完善该方法并解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的方法，通过任务分解、多轮交互和自定义工具来生成高质量的分析报告，解决了传统手动分析效率低和单次指令输入无法获得结构化报告的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代战争中仿真推演的数据分析和性能评估至关重要，但传统手动分析方法耗时且易出错。大语言模型虽然具备强大分析能力，但单次指令输入无法获得结构化的高质量分析报告。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为多个子任务，为每个子任务设计有效的系统提示和用户提示；通过多轮交互结合自检和反思实现结构化数据提取和多步分析评估；定义和调用自定义工具生成图表和计算指标；设计多种报告模板以适应不同场景。

Result: 广泛评估结果表明，该方法生成的报告质量更高，相比基线方法获得了更高的评分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效利用大语言模型生成高质量、结构化的分析报告，在军事仿真推演的数据分析中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

*Qihang Zhang,Muchen Li,Ziao Wang,Renjie Liao,Lele Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于加权专家乘积（wPoE）的测试时引导框架，将通用压缩模型与预训练神经语言模型自适应结合，确保压缩率至少与最佳单个模型相当，无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通用压缩器（如gzip）计算开销低、速度快、适用性广，但压缩率不如现代神经压缩器；神经压缩器虽然能更好建模数据分布，但难以泛化到未见数据。

Method: 使用加权专家乘积（wPoE）框架，在推理时自适应地结合通用压缩模型和预训练神经语言模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，且能无缝集成到任何自回归语言模型中。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用解决方案，确保压缩率不低于最佳单个模型。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在历史人物对话系统中面临关键权衡：简单的检索增强生成产生浅层响应，而多阶段反思虽然深度但延迟过高。

Method: 将传记数据转化为1774个丰富的第一人称记忆，带有情感语义元数据，采用两阶段检索实现0.52秒的提示生成。

Result: 评估显示该方法在GPT-4上与传统RAG相当，在较小模型(GPT-3.5、GPT-3)上显著优于传统RAG，特别适合资源受限部署。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅作为对话界面，还作为传记分析的研究工具，具有时空热图、情感轨迹分析和交互路径跟踪等可视化功能，适用于教育、博物馆和研究应用。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了第一个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型HyQuT，能够在8M和150M参数规模下将变分量子电路集成到Transformer框架中，实现连贯的上下文感知对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然量子计算越来越多地应用于替代经典计算，但大多数现有量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，迄今尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。

Method: 提出的架构将变分量子电路（VQCs）集成到Transformer框架中，在8M和150M参数规模下进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，最少数量的量子比特（10个量子比特和80个量子门）可以替代150M参数模型中约10%的经典参数，同时实现相当的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型提供了早期可行性证明。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理时间约束时存在系统性风险，包括双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，即使通过微调也无法可靠学习时间约束满足能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要实时决策的智能体架构中部署LLM时，假设它们能可靠判断行动窗口是否开放，但这个假设未经测试。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务评估8个生产级模型（2.8-8B参数），分析时间约束处理能力，并进行200个合成示例的微调实验。

Result: 发现双峰性能分布（95%或50%准确率）、极端提示脆弱性（格式变化导致30-60个百分点波动）、系统性行动偏见（失败模型100%假阳性率），参数数量与能力无相关性，微调仅对部分能力模型有12-37个百分点提升。

Conclusion: 时间约束满足能力无法通过自然语言的下一个词预测可靠学习，需要连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统组合推理的架构机制，当前自回归架构缺乏这些机制。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了谱神经符号推理框架，引入了三个基于语义的增强：基于Transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴涵验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在保持核心谱推理流程的同时提高了图质量和推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱神经符号推理框架在处理冗余节点、低质量边和缺失上下文时存在局限性，需要在不改变核心推理引擎的情况下提升图的保真度和推理性能。

Method: 提出了三种语义增强方法：(1) 使用上下文嵌入的Transformer节点合并减少冗余；(2) 预训练NLI分类器的句子级蕴涵验证改进边质量；(3) 与外部知识图谱对齐增强缺失上下文。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中，准确率提升达3.8%，对抗性案例泛化能力增强，推理噪声减少。

Conclusion: 通过在谱推理阶段之前进行语义和符号细化，实现了高效、可解释和可扩展的推理，无需依赖二次注意力机制，构建了更稳健的推理系统。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动指定偏好权重，给用户带来负担且导致训练效率低下，需要自动化的多目标对齐方案。

Method: 使用轻量级偏好适配器，基于多个奖励模型的归一化奖励分数自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法优于固定权重方法，多个任务的实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PRO框架能够自动推断提示特定偏好权重，在多目标对齐场景中实现更优性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上的特定失败模式：产生过度均匀的嵌入，丧失语义凝聚力。专利文档固有的多部分结构提供了自然的语义和结构多样性。

Method: 提出基于部分的增强方法，将专利的不同部分（摘要、权利要求、背景等）作为互补视图进行对比学习，引入自然语义和结构多样性。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在现有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时避免了对脆弱或不完整标注的依赖。分析显示不同部分专门适用于不同任务：权利要求和摘要有利于检索，背景部分有助于分类。

Conclusion: 利用文档内部视图进行可扩展和通用化的专利理解具有重要价值，专利固有的语篇结构对表示学习具有显著益处。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一任务、有限模型和英文报告，需要评估开源LLM在多疾病、多语言、多机构临床记录中的结构化信息提取能力。

Method: 使用15个开源LLM（包括通用和医学专用模型），在6种疾病案例中评估6种提示策略（零样本、一样本、少样本、思维链、自一致性和提示图），采用共识排名聚合和线性混合效应模型分析方差。

Result: 表现最佳的模型在各任务中接近评分者间一致性水平，中小型通用模型与大型模型性能相当，提示图和少样本提示可提升约13%性能，任务特定因素比模型大小或提示策略影响更大。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而概率文本生成策略会引入额外的不确定性，需要更严谨的统计方法来准确评估模型行为。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法量化二进制评估指标的不确定性，特别关注由LLM概率文本生成策略引起的不确定性。通过两个案例研究验证方法：1）评估对抗性输入上的拒绝率，2）评估开放对话中的成对偏好。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯不确定性量化方法能够更准确地评估大语言模型的行为，特别是在涉及概率文本生成策略的二进制评估场景中，为模型评估提供了更严谨的统计基础。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对7个前沿大语言模型在粤语、日语和土耳其语上的表现进行了全面评估，发现虽然大型专有模型表现最佳，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面仍存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言（如英语）上表现出色，但在低资源和形态丰富语言中的有效性尚未充分探索，因此需要对这些语言进行系统评估。

Method: 创建了一个跨语言基准测试，涵盖粤语、日语和土耳其语，包含四个任务：开放域问答、文档摘要、英译X和文化对话。结合人工评估（流畅度、事实准确性、文化适当性）和自动指标（BLEU、ROUGE）来评估模型性能。

Result: 最大的专有模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4、Claude 3.5）在语言和任务上普遍领先，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面存在显著差距。GPT-4o在多语言任务上表现稳健，Claude 3.5在知识和推理基准上达到竞争性准确度。所有模型都在各语言独特挑战上存在困难，如土耳其语的粘着形态和粤语的口语表达。较小的开源模型（LLaMA-2-13B、Mistral-7B）在流畅度和准确性上明显落后。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLMs在文化意识和语言泛化能力方面的局限性，强调了开发更具文化意识和语言泛化能力的大语言模型的必要性。发布了基准测试和评估数据以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督框架，通过使用偏斜感知聚合策略来提高防护模型的语义鲁棒性，减少语义变异性58%，提升基准准确率2.5%，并改善模型校准40%。


<details>

Motivation: 防护模型对表面语言变化的敏感性是其关键弱点，即使含义保持不变的改写也会导致安全评分大幅波动，表明缺乏语义基础。

Method: 引入实用的自监督框架，利用改写集通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制预测一致性，以计算鲁棒目标。

Result: 方法将语义变异性降低约58%，基准准确率平均提高约2.5%，并能泛化到未见过的风格变化，同时改善模型校准达40%。

Conclusion: 应将语义一致性作为首要训练目标，该研究为构建更可靠的防护模型提供了可扩展的方案。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然预测准确率高，但正确性并不等同于真正的理解能力。需要评估模型是否能像人类专家一样在不同场景下做出基于正确决策因素的一致决策。

Method: 引入STaDS框架，通过结构化决策"考试"评估LLMs在三个方面的理解能力：问题理解、知识预测和决策因素依赖。分析了9个前沿LLMs在15个不同决策场景中的表现。

Result: 研究发现：(a)大多数模型难以在不同领域保持强一致性准确率；(b)模型可能准确但不忠实，预测驱动因素与陈述理由经常不匹配。

Conclusion: 需要超越准确率的全局理解评估协议，开发新框架来增强LLMs的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了传统机器学习与深度迁移学习在预测儿童人工耳蜗植入后语言发展方面的表现，发现基于双线性注意力融合策略的深度迁移学习模型在准确率、敏感性和特异性方面均优于传统机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工耳蜗植入显著改善了重度至极重度感音神经性听力损失儿童的口语能力，但结果变异性较大，且无法通过植入年龄或残余听力可靠预测个体儿童的语言发展结果。

Method: 研究纳入了来自三个中心的278名植入儿童，使用基于脑神经解剖特征的传统机器学习和深度迁移学习算法，构建高语言改善者与低语言改善者的二元分类预测模型。

Result: 深度迁移学习预测模型实现了92.39%的准确率、91.22%的敏感性和93.56%的特异性，AUC为0.977，在所有结果指标上均优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 深度迁移学习通过直接捕获判别性和任务特定信息，显著提升了预测性能，支持开发适用于全球人工耳蜗项目的单一深度迁移学习预测模型的可行性。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码切换语音翻译面临语义建模复杂和CS数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法依赖模型隐式学习语义且需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 使用MoE语音投影器增强LLM，每个专家专精特定语言的语义子空间；采用多阶段训练范式，利用单语ASR和ST数据；结合语言特定损失、组内负载均衡损失和过渡损失进行训练。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决代码切换语音翻译中的关键挑战，通过MoE结构和多阶段训练实现了更好的语义建模和数据利用。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出GVF微调方法，通过事实锚点数据增强、事实感知指令调优和事实一致性损失函数三个核心机制，系统性地提升多模态大语言模型的视觉事实一致性，显著减少视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在视觉幻觉问题，即生成与图像内容不一致的细节，这严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的微调方法改进有限，未能深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: GVF微调方法包含三个核心机制：1) 事实锚点数据增强，用结构化事实锚点和反事实提示丰富训练数据；2) 事实感知指令调优，将这些线索嵌入到显式指令中；3) 事实一致性损失函数，专门惩罚事实不准确性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B模型上评估，GVF微调在VHTest基准测试中显著优于标准微调，在开放式问题和是/否问题格式上都表现更好。同时，在MME和POPE等多模态基准测试中保持甚至略微提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF微调方法能够有效缓解视觉幻觉问题，同时不损害一般的理解和推理能力，为提升多模态大语言模型的可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段演示选择方法TopK + L2D，通过结合语义相似性和标签分布对齐来改进上下文学习中的演示选择，在多个文本分类基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的演示选择方法主要关注测试输入与演示之间的语义相似性，往往忽视了标签分布对齐的重要性，这限制了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的性能。

Method: 提出两阶段演示选择方法：首先基于语义相似性选择TopK候选演示，然后使用微调的BERT类小语言模型生成标签分布并计算与测试输入的标签分布差异，选择标签分布对齐的演示。

Result: 在七个文本分类基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于之前的演示选择策略。进一步分析显示LLM性能与用于标签分布估计的SLM准确性呈正相关。

Conclusion: 结合语义相似性和标签分布对齐的演示选择方法能有效提升上下文学习性能，且底层SLM的准确性对LLM性能有重要影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

TL;DR: SpiderGen是一个基于LLM的工作流，结合传统生命周期评估（LCA）的分类学和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识，用于生成LCA所需的程序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和全球变暖主要由温室气体排放引起，而消费者产品的生产、使用和处置是重要排放源。因此需要构建工具来评估消费者产品的环境影响，其中生命周期评估（LCA）是关键组成部分。

Method: 开发SpiderGen工作流，将传统LCA的分类学和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识相结合，生成用于LCA的程序信息。

Result: SpiderGen提供准确或仅有轻微错误的LCA过程信息，在10个样本数据点上达到62%的F1分数。相比基线技术（如思维链提示和单样本提示）表现更好，且能以低于1美元的成本在10分钟内生成LCA过程信息，而传统LCA成本超过25000美元且需要21人天。

Conclusion: SpiderGen有潜力显著减少估算碳影响所需的人力和成本，尽管在细节和辅助过程范围方面仍存在一些差异导致的错误。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Conclusion: 研究确立了稳态准确率作为交互场景下的原则性鲁棒性指标，揭示了模型在重复提问下的脆弱性。解决这种不稳定性对于在高风险交互场景中部署LLM至关重要，其中一致性推理与初始准确率同等重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归提示虽然能规模化生成合成数据集，但存在偏见放大的风险，需要研究偏见动态和缓解策略。

Method: 使用三种互补评估框架（基于规则的模式匹配、基于嵌入的语义相似性、下游任务性能），在三种初始偏见水平和四种缓解策略下进行实验。

Result: 低初始偏见会向模型固有偏见水平放大（+36%），高初始偏见会衰减（-26%）；对比增强方法能显著降低下游偏见（平均91%），但产生更高的嵌入偏见分数。

Conclusion: 语义相似性指标可能与行为公平结果不一致，强调在负责任合成数据生成中需要多维评估。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Method: 设计了包含六个淘汰式关卡的动态对抗性评估环境，让LLM与其他LLM对手进行交互式游戏对战，评估50多个LLM模型。

Result: 观察到同一模型谱系中明显的代际性能跃迁，发现某些模型采用投机性捷径获胜，表明静态基准可能存在更高级别的评估范式污染。动态评估可作为静态评估的补充。

Conclusion: 动态对抗性评估能够提供对LLM能力的更全面理解，是静态基准测试的重要补充，有助于建立更可信的评估框架。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

*Eyal Rabin,Zohar Elyoseph,Rotem Israel-Fishelson,Adi Dali,Ravit Nussinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明AI语音系统能够隐式学习人类社交规范，在礼貌提示下会降低语速来传达礼貌，这与人类行为一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究最先进的文本转语音系统是否内化了人类通过降低语速来传达礼貌的倾向，这是一种非明显的韵律标记。

Method: 使用两个领先AI平台（AI Studio和OpenAI）的22个合成声音，在"礼貌正式"和"随意非正式"条件下朗读固定脚本，测量语音持续时间。

Result: 在两个AI平台中，礼貌提示产生的语速都比随意提示慢，效应量非常大。AI Studio的所有声音和OpenAI的大多数声音都显示出统计显著性。

Conclusion: AI能够隐式学习和复制人类沟通的心理细微差别，突显其作为能够强化人类社交规范的社会行为者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大型语言模型在国际关系领域的国家层面偏见，基于联合国安理会历史记录开发了偏见评估框架，发现模型存在多维偏见，并提出结合检索增强生成和反思技术的去偏见框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在国际关系领域的应用日益增多，评估和解决这些模型的国家层面偏见变得至关重要，以确保公平和准确的国际关系分析。

Method: 基于联合国安理会历史记录开发了包含三个测试的偏见评估框架，重点评估五个常任理事国。提出了结合检索增强生成和反思技术的去偏见框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，不同LLM存在不同的国家偏见模式（如对西方国家有利、对俄罗斯不利），偏见方向和程度随评估情境变化。推理能力更强的模型偏见更少、性能更好。提出的去偏见框架有效减少了国家层面偏见，特别是在GPT-4o-mini和LLama-3.3-70B中表现显著。

Conclusion: LLM的偏见本质上是多维的，在不同模型和任务中表现不同。在国际关系领域应用LLM时，需要同时评估国家层面偏见和性能表现，以确保公平准确的分析结果。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ΠAttention，一种周期性稀疏Transformer，通过将注意力分解为环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，在保持线性复杂度的同时扩展了感受野，在语言建模等任务中优于密集注意力和RingAttention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模，现有稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention感受野有限且缺乏适应性，需要一种既能保持线性复杂度又能有效覆盖远距离token的注意力机制。

Method: 将注意力分解为三个组件：环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，通过周期性结构提供可预测的远距离token覆盖，同时保持稀疏性实现线性复杂度。

Result: ΠAttention在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中达到或超过密集注意力的质量，比RingAttention困惑度降低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用量减少50%，感受野增长为O(kL + πlogL)。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头部级稀疏协调对于高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Conclusion: 忠实度是可靠医疗摘要的重要维度，该方法展示了在医疗环境中更安全部署LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型越来越多地用于教育任务如评分，但其在真实课堂环境中与人类评估的一致性仍缺乏充分研究。本研究旨在验证LLM在实际学术评估中的有效性。

Method: 收集约50名学生在5次测验中的简答题回答和14个团队的项目报告，使用GPT-4o进行评分，并与课程助教独立进行的人工评估进行比较分析。

Result: GPT-4o与人类评分者表现出强相关性（最高达0.98），在55%的测验案例中得分完全一致。对于项目报告，虽然总体上与人类评分一致，但在技术性、开放式回答的评分上存在一定变异性。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了基于LLM的评分系统的潜力和局限性，为推进现实学术环境中的自动评分做出了贡献，并发布了所有代码和样本数据以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Motivation: 探究多语言大语言模型如何内部表示多种语言，是否存在共享的多语言表示和语言特定解码机制，以及为什么性能仍然偏向主导训练语言。

Method: 训练一系列不同多语言数据混合的LLMs，使用跨层转码器和归因图分析内部机制，通过干预语言特征进行实验。

Result: 发现模型采用枢轴语言表示机制，解码部分依赖于最后几层中的高频语言特征，这些特征从模型第一层线性读取语言身份。通过干预这些特征可以控制语言输出。

Conclusion: 理解枢轴语言机制对于改进LLMs中的多语言对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为合并和转移不同LLM家族间的专业技能提供了有效途径，减少了冗余微调并增强了模型适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各种任务中作为评判者被广泛使用，特别是在涉及日常社交互动的任务中，需要了解LLM是否能可靠地评估需要社交或对话判断的任务。

Method: 构建评估框架，对比模型在直接事实查询和对话判断任务中的表现。通过将查询从"这个陈述正确吗？"转变为"这个说话者正确吗？"，并在两种条件下施加简单反驳压力，测量模型在对话压力下保持立场的坚定程度。

Result: 研究发现，即使是最小的对话上下文也能显著改变模型判断。GPT-4o-mini在社交框架任务中表现出谄媚倾向，而Llama-8B-Instruct变得过度批判。所有模型的平均性能变化为9.24%。

Conclusion: 对话框架是LLM评估中的关键因素。提出的框架为诊断模型信念提供了可复现的方法论，有助于开发更可信的对话系统。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

Conclusion: 工具使用会损害语言模型的推理能力，但通过偏好优化框架可以改善工具使用方式，同时提升最终答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

TL;DR: EMSQA是一个包含24.3K个医学选择题的数据集，覆盖10个临床学科和4个认证级别。研究者提出了Expert-CoT和ExpertRAG方法，通过结合专业领域知识和检索增强生成，显著提升了LLMs在医学问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在医学问答中往往忽视专业领域知识（如临床学科和认证级别），限制了在高风险环境下的性能。需要开发能够利用结构化专业知识的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Expert-CoT（基于特定临床学科和认证级别的思维链提示策略）和ExpertRAG（基于学科对齐文档和真实患者数据的检索增强生成管道）。

Result: Expert-CoT相比普通CoT提示提升了2.05%；结合ExpertRAG相比标准RAG基线提升了4.59%准确率；32B专业增强LLMs通过了所有EMS认证模拟考试。

Conclusion: 结合专业领域知识和检索增强生成能够显著提升LLMs在医学问答中的性能，特别是在高风险的专业认证环境中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.

TL;DR: CardioEmbed是一个基于Qwen3-Embedding-8B的领域专用嵌入模型，通过对比学习在7本心脏病学教科书上训练，在心脏特定语义检索任务中达到99.60%的检索准确率，比当前最先进的医学嵌入模型MedTE提升了15.94个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生物医学文本嵌入模型主要基于PubMed研究文献开发，但临床心脏病学实践严重依赖程序性知识和专业术语，这些内容主要存在于综合教科书中而非研究摘要中，这种研究实践差距限制了现有嵌入模型在心脏病学临床应用中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen3-Embedding-8B模型，使用对比学习在精选的7本综合心脏病学教科书语料库上进行训练，经过去重后约150,000个句子，采用带有批内负样本的InfoNCE损失函数。

Result: 在心脏特定语义检索任务中达到99.60%的检索准确率，比MedTE模型提升了15.94个百分点；在MTEB医学基准测试中，BIOSSES得分为0.77 Spearman，SciFact得分为0.61 NDCG@10，表明在相关生物医学领域具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于综合临床教科书的领域专用训练能够实现近乎完美的心脏病学检索性能（99.60% Acc@1），比MedTE模型提升了15.94个百分点。

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

TL;DR: DiscoX是一个用于评估专业领域中文-英文篇章级翻译的新基准，包含7个领域的200篇专业文本，平均长度超过1700词。同时开发了无参考评估系统Metric-S，在准确性、流畅性和适当性方面提供细粒度自动评估。实验显示即使最先进的LLM仍显著落后于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译评估方法主要关注句子级准确性和流畅性，无法充分评估专业领域篇章级翻译所需的连贯性和术语精确性，这限制了知识传播和跨语言学术交流的质量评估。

Method: 构建DiscoX基准数据集，包含7个专业领域的200篇专业文本；开发Metric-S无参考评估系统，提供准确性、流畅性和适当性的细粒度自动评估；通过实验比较先进LLM与人类专家的表现。

Result: Metric-S与人类判断具有强一致性，显著优于现有评估指标；实验发现即使最先进的LLM在DiscoX任务上仍显著落后于人类专家，验证了该基准的难度。

Conclusion: DiscoX基准和Metric-S评估系统为更严格的翻译评估提供了稳健框架，揭示了实现专业级机器翻译仍面临的挑战，有助于推动LLM翻译技术的未来发展。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO数据集缺乏系统比较，主要由于计算成本高和缺乏丰富质量标注，难以理解偏好选择方式、任务类型覆盖范围以及人类判断的反映程度。

Method: 使用Magpie框架对每个样本进行任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励的标注，通过奖励模型验证偏好顺序，实现跨数据集的可扩展细粒度质量检查。

Result: 揭示了不同数据集在奖励边际上的结构和质量差异，构建的UltraMix数据集比最佳个体数据集小30%但在关键基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心分析可以识别和消除噪声样本，构建更高效的DPO数据集，为数据中心偏好优化研究提供了有价值的资源和工具。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用于生成结构化输出，但现有的结构化生成方法虽然确保有效性，却缺乏输出多样性，这是一个关键限制。

Method: 利用自动机遍历历史来引导LLM朝着新颖的结构模式发展，从而增强基于自动机的结构化生成的多样性。

Result: 评估显示该方法显著提高了结构和内容多样性，同时保持了可比的生成效率。案例研究展示了在生成开源库测试用例方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了结构化生成中多样性不足的问题，为LLM在结构化输出生成任务中的应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现当前文本嵌入模型存在一致的偏差，并提出了一种无需训练、轻量级的重归一化方法来解决此问题，显著提升了在MMTEB基准上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有文本嵌入模型的输出存在系统性偏差，即所有嵌入向量都包含一个几乎相同的偏差分量μ，这影响了模型的性能表现。

Method: 提出重归一化方法，有两种变体：直接从嵌入向量中减去偏差μ，或减去嵌入向量在μ方向上的投影分量。该方法无需额外训练，可直接应用于现有模型。

Result: 在38个模型上的实验表明，重归一化显著提升了MMTEB基准的性能：检索任务提升9.7σ，分类任务提升3.1σ，其他任务提升0.8σ。理论预测和实验都证实投影版本效果更好。

Conclusion: 重归一化是一种有效、轻量级的解决方案，能够一致且显著地提升现有文本嵌入模型的性能，特别是投影版本效果更优。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅回答但有时会产生事实幻觉，需要研究LLMs能否检测自身幻觉。

Method: 将幻觉检测制定为句子分类任务，提出评估框架和使用Chain-of-Thought从参数中提取知识的分类方法。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-3.5 Turbo结合CoT能检测58.2%的自身幻觉。

Conclusion: 如果参数中包含足够知识，结合CoT的LLMs能够检测幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Conclusion: 任务特定的现代语言模型适应可以为政治传播研究做出贡献，展示了语言模型在分析政治话语中的实用价值。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

TL;DR: 提出了SAP²方法，一种两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词的新框架，用于解决ASR系统在需要领域特定知识的场景中难以利用长上下文信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在常见条件下表现出色，但在需要领域特定知识的情境化场景中难以利用长上下文信息，主要由于受限的模型上下文窗口和广泛上下文噪声中相关信息稀疏性。

Method: SAP²方法采用两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词，每个阶段利用提出的语音驱动注意力池化机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上达到最先进性能，词错误率分别为7.71%和1.12%。在SlideSpeech上，相比非上下文基线显著降低偏置关键词错误率41.1%。

Conclusion: SAP²方法在广泛上下文输入条件下在两个数据集上都表现出稳健的可扩展性，持续保持性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

TL;DR: 本文为副词提出了一个基于语言学的上位义类型学，扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，并通过实证验证证明了该分类系统的可靠性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet为名词和动词提供了丰富的上位义层次结构，但副词缺乏系统的语义分类，这限制了自然语言处理应用的发展。

Method: 引入基于语言学的副词上位义类型学，包括方式、时间、频率、程度、领域、说话者导向和主语导向等主要语义域，并通过试点标注研究进行实证验证。

Result: 试点标注研究表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且人类标注者能够可靠地分配这些类别。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了下游NLP应用如词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和语篇建模的发展。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LANE的对抗性训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，旨在增强神经语言模型对细粒度词义的分辨能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析方面存在挑战，它们往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节。

Method: 提出LANE对抗性训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词生成负训练样本，迫使模型在具有不同标记词的相同句子之间创建更大的可分离性。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法产生了更具区分性的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。

Conclusion: LANE方法能够生成更好的词表示，即使在具有挑战性的环境中也能更好地捕捉细微的意义差异，且该方法与模型无关，可以集成到现有的表示学习框架中。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将基于规则的模板生成与LLM精炼相结合，为知识图谱问答生成提供了可扩展且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

### [137] [iMAD: Intelligent Multi-Agent Debate for Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11306)
*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD是一个智能的多智能体辩论框架，通过选择性触发辩论来显著降低计算成本，同时提高答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论框架对每个查询都进行辩论，导致计算成本高昂，且可能推翻正确的单智能体答案。

Method: iMAD从单智能体的结构化自我批评响应中提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征，使用轻量级辩论决策分类器（采用FocusCal损失训练）来决定是否触发多智能体辩论。

Result: 在六个视觉问答数据集上的实验表明，iMAD显著减少了token使用量（最高达92%），同时提高了最终答案准确率（最高达13.5%）。

Conclusion: iMAD通过智能地选择性触发辩论，实现了计算效率和准确性的双重提升，为多智能体辩论系统提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LAET（Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning）的新策略，通过分析隐藏状态表示来选择性地微调预训练大语言模型中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层，显著降低了计算开销并提升了任务特定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BloombergGPT、FinMA等大语言模型在金融NLP任务中表现出色，但其高计算需求限制了众多组织的可访问性。为了解决这一问题，需要开发更高效的模型微调方法。

Method: 采用层间自适应集成调优（LAET）策略，通过分析隐藏状态表示来识别预训练LLM中最有效的层，仅对这些关键层进行选择性微调，同时冻结其他层以减少计算负担。

Result: LAET在金融NLP任务中表现出强劲结果，超越了现有基准和最先进的LLM（如GPT-4），即使使用较小的LLM（约30亿参数）也能实现优异性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过高效可扩展的模型，将前沿的金融NLP研究与实际部署连接起来，为金融应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型与人类婴儿在语言学习能力上的差异，特别是对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现对比。

Method: 回顾文献分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，比较其与人类婴儿学习模式的差异。

Result: 语言模型经常能很好地学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，而难以学习的不可能语言通常更复杂或随机。语言模型缺乏人类特有的归纳偏差。

Conclusion: 语言模型在语言学习方面与人类婴儿存在重要差异，主要在于缺乏支持语言习得的特定归纳偏差。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助手，无需用户明确提示即可自动识别和分离对话伙伴，提高在多人对话环境中的听觉体验。

Method: 采用双模型架构：轻量级流式模型每12.5毫秒运行一次用于低延迟提取对话伙伴，较慢模型运行频率较低以捕捉长范围对话动态。系统基于自我中心双耳音频，利用佩戴者的自我语音作为锚点。

Result: 在真实世界的2人和3人对话测试集上（来自11名参与者的6.8小时双耳自我中心硬件数据）显示，系统在多对话环境中能够泛化识别和隔离对话伙伴。

Conclusion: 这项工作是朝着能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助手迈出的一步，展示了在真实多对话场景中识别和分离对话伙伴的能力。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Motivation: 现有学术基准测试对现实世界专业环境中的表现评估有限，特别是在法律和金融等高风险领域，无法充分评估开放式、具有经济影响的任务。

Method: 开发PRBench基准测试，包含1100个专家编写的任务和19356个专家制定的评估标准，招募182名合格专业人士参与任务设计，任务覆盖114个国家和47个美国司法管辖区。

Conclusion: 当前模型在专业领域的可靠性存在关键差距，具有相似总体得分的模型在具体能力上可能显著不同，模型在专业应用中的可靠性仍需大幅提升。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了人工智能伦理熵的概念，类比热力学第二定律，证明无约束AI会自发偏离目标，需要持续的对齐工作来维持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI系统在训练后自发偏离原始目标的问题，作者希望建立一个类似热力学的理论框架来量化AI对齐问题。

Method: 定义了基于目标概率分布的伦理熵概念，推导了熵增定理和临界对齐工作边界，并通过模拟实验验证理论。

Result: 实验显示，70亿参数模型在无约束情况下熵从0.32增加到1.69±1.08纳特，而使用1.5倍临界对齐工作的系统能保持稳定在0.00±0.00纳特。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护高级自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多目标决策问题需要从Pareto最优解集中选择最具代表性的子集，以减轻决策者的认知负担。现有质量度量方法存在一些不直观的行为，需要更好的度量方法和计算复杂性分析。

Method: 将Pareto修剪问题重新定义为多赢家投票问题，进行公理化分析，提出新的directed coverage度量方法，分析不同质量度量的计算复杂性边界，并进行实验评估。

Result: 发现了现有质量度量方法的非直观行为，提出了新的directed coverage度量方法，识别了可处理与难处理情况的计算复杂性边界，实验表明质量度量的选择对所选解集特性有决定性影响。

Conclusion: 提出的directed coverage度量方法在各种设置下表现具有竞争力甚至更优，为多目标决策中的代表性解集选择提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

Motivation: 研究团宽度在编码中的能力，因为虽然团宽度比树宽度更通用（对稠密图也有效），但关于其编码能力的研究很少。抽象论证框架作为基于有向图的推理框架，是研究计算性质的理想候选。

Method: 设计了从论证问题到(Q)SAT的新归约方法，称为有向分解引导(DDG)归约，这些归约线性保持团宽度。

Conclusion: 本文开启了理解团宽度编码能力的研究，通过抽象论证框架展示了团宽度在编码复杂性中的重要作用，并提供了高效的归约方法。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不确定性下的反事实决策中，决策者通常通过比较候选行动的期望潜在结果来做出选择。本文旨在开发新的决策规则，通过引入PoR和PoB指标来更准确地评估个体层面的潜在结果排序和最优结果概率。

Method: 建立了PoR和PoB指标的识别定理和边界，提出了相应的估计方法，并通过数值实验验证了估计器的有限样本特性，最后在实际数据集上进行了应用演示。

Result: 成功推导了PoR和PoB的识别条件，开发了有效的估计方法，数值实验表明估计器具有良好的有限样本性能，并在真实数据应用中展示了这些指标的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的PoR和PoB指标为反事实决策提供了新的分析工具，能够更精确地评估个体层面的潜在结果排序和最优结果概率，为不确定性下的决策制定提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了自适应推理的概念，将推理能力重新定义为根据任务难度和不确定性动态分配计算资源的能力，并建立了系统化的分类法来组织现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在推理时采用统一的策略，无法根据任务复杂度调整推理深度，导致简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足。论文旨在解决这一根本挑战。

Method: 论文首先形式化了演绎、归纳和溯因推理在LLM中的实现，然后将自适应推理建模为控制增强的策略优化问题，最后提出了基于训练和免训练的两大类自适应推理方法分类法。

Result: 建立了一个系统化的框架来分类和分析现有的自适应推理方法，包括基于训练的方法（强化学习、监督微调、学习控制器）和免训练方法（提示条件、反馈驱动停止、模块化组合）。

Conclusion: 该框架澄清了不同机制如何实现自适应推理，并支持跨策略的系统比较。论文最后指出了自我评估、元推理和人类对齐推理控制等开放挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

TL;DR: HyperComplEx是一个混合知识图谱嵌入框架，通过注意力机制自适应结合双曲空间、复数空间和欧几里得空间，解决了现有方法在处理不同关系类型时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法在处理大规模多样化关系类型时存在关键限制：欧几里得模型难以处理层次结构，向量空间模型无法捕捉不对称性，双曲模型在对称关系上表现不佳。

Method: 提出关系特定的空间加权策略，通过学习注意力机制为每种关系类型动态选择最优几何空间，同时使用多空间一致性损失确保跨空间预测的一致性。

Result: 在从1K论文到10M论文的知识图谱上评估，相比TransE、RotatE、DistMult等基线方法持续改进。在10M论文数据集上达到0.612 MRR，比最佳基线相对提升4.8%，同时保持高效训练和85ms每三元组的推理速度。

Conclusion: HyperComplEx通过自适应维度分配实现与图谱大小的近线性扩展，为可扩展知识图谱嵌入研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法过度简化了脑连接性的复杂关系，假设单一模态的脑连接组作为疾病传播基质，导致病理传播预测不准确。同时，纯数据驱动的方法由于缺乏适当约束而面临可识别性问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型作为区域变量相互作用的专家指导，通过LLM合成多模态关系和整合多样疾病驱动机制的能力，同时优化长期疾病轨迹构建和生物约束的图结构学习。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM的专家知识和生物约束，显著提高了神经退行性疾病进展建模的准确性和可解释性，为理解疾病传播机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的不完全方法来打破抽象结构的对称性，通过更好地利用其表示形式来处理约束编程中常见的对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束编程中，使用高级建模语言（如Essence）表达问题时涉及抽象结构，这些结构需要转换为求解器支持的表示形式。对称性破坏是加速求解的重要技术，但应用于抽象变量时会产生大量复杂约束，性能较差。

Method: 开发了一种新的不完全对称性破坏方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示形式来破坏由不可区分对象引起的对称性。

Result: 与之前的方法（Akgün et al. 2025）相比，该方法速度更快。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法在破坏抽象结构对称性方面比现有方法更有效，能够显著提升约束求解性能。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Motivation: 当前多智能体辩论研究忽视了角色分配策略的重要性，特别是在实际应用中真理未知的情况下如何优化辩论机制。

Method: 提出"真理最后"角色分配策略，并开发多智能体辩论一致性(MADC)策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，模拟最高一致性得分的角色作为真理。

Result: 在9个LLM模型上验证，MADC策略持续表现出先进性能，有效克服了多智能体辩论的性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: MADC策略为LLM智能体扩展提供了重要改进路径，显著提升了多智能体辩论在推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习有效的广义计划和搜索空间剪枝公理，为广义规划提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法在安全性、效用和运营成本之间存在权衡困难，且仅关注最终输出的过程盲目性会浪费大量计算资源在不安全的推理上，导致有害推理可以通过良性理由伪装来规避安全检测。

Method: 将LVLM视为有限理性智能体，逐步扩展思维图，使用前瞻性函数（类似净现值）对行动进行评分，动态权衡预期安全性、效用和成本与剩余预算，并通过最弱环节原则强制执行路径安全性。

Result: 在3个闭源和2个开源模型、6个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EcoAlign以更低的计算成本达到或超越了最先进的安全性和效用水平。

Conclusion: EcoAlign为稳健的LVLM对齐提供了一条原则性、经济性的路径，有效解决了安全性、效用和成本之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle.

Result: 通过沉浸式VR实验证明，RLSLM在用户体验上优于最先进的基于规则模型，消融和敏感性分析显示其比传统数据驱动方法具有显著改进的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，用于现实世界的社会导航应用。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

TL;DR: 本文综述了在多智能体强化学习（MARL）中，针对现实通信约束（如消息扰动、传输延迟和带宽限制）的鲁棒高效通信策略的最新进展，并探讨了在自动驾驶、分布式SLAM和联邦学习等应用中的实践挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法大多假设通信是瞬时、可靠且带宽无限的，但这些条件在现实部署中很少满足，因此需要研究在现实约束下的鲁棒高效通信策略。

Method: 系统综述了在消息扰动、传输延迟和有限带宽等现实约束下的MARL通信策略进展，重点关注低延迟可靠性、带宽密集型数据共享和通信隐私权衡等核心挑战。

Result: 识别了三个关键应用领域（协作自动驾驶、分布式SLAM和联邦学习）中的通信挑战，并提出了统一方法，共同设计通信、学习和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要采用统一的方法来共同设计通信、学习和鲁棒性，以弥合理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距，并指出了未来的关键开放挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

*Xiaxin Li,Arya Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出两种在一位压缩感知中实现亚线性运行时间的支持恢复方案：一种是通用精确支持恢复，另一种是通用ε近似支持恢复，以及概率精确支持恢复方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一比特压缩感知支持恢复方法运行时间通常为Ω(n)，本文旨在开发具有亚线性运行时间o(n)的高效算法。

Method: 提出两种方案：(1) 通用支持恢复方案，包括精确恢复和ε近似恢复；(2) 亚线性机制下的概率精确支持恢复方案。

Result: 通用精确支持恢复：m=O(k²log(n/k)logn)测量数，D=O(km)运行时间；通用ε近似支持恢复：m=O(kε⁻¹log(n/k)logn)测量数，D=O(ε⁻¹m)运行时间；概率精确支持恢复：m=O(k(logk/loglogk)logn)测量数，O(m)运行时间。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方案显著改善了支持恢复的运行时间，从线性时间降低到亚线性时间，同时测量数仅增加对数因子，为大规模稀疏信号支持恢复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $Ω(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1.i): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. (1.ii): For the universal $ε$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(kε^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(ε^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.

Conclusion: 提出的连续互耦合模型准确描述了阵列性能，极化效应使传统半波长间距规则失效，耦合波束成形能实现更高的方向性，为阵列设计提供了更准确的物理基础。

Abstract: The phenomenon of mutual coupling in continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) is studied. First, a general physical model for the phenomenon that accounts for both polarization and surface dissipation losses is developed. Then, the unipolarized coupling kernel is characterized, revealing that polarization induces anisotropic coupling and invalidates the conventional half-wavelength spacing rule for coupling elimination. Next, the beamforming design problem for CAPAs with coupling is formulated as a functional optimization problem, leading to the derivation of optimal beamforming structures via the calculus of variations. To address the challenge of inverting the coupling kernel in the optimal structure, two methods are proposed: 1) the kernel approximation method, which yields a closed-form solution via wavenumber-domain transformation and GaussLegendre quadrature, and 2) the conjugate gradient method, which addresses an equivalent quadratic functional optimization problem iteratively. Furthermore, the optimal array gain and beampattern are analyzed at the large-aperture limit. Finally, the proposed continuous mutual coupling model is extended to spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), and comprehensive numerical results are provided, demonstrating that: 1) coupled SPDA performance correctly converges to the CAPA limit, while uncoupled models are shown to violate physics, 2) polarization results in anisotropic array gain behavior, and 3) the coupled beampattern exhibits higher directivity than the uncoupled beampattern.

Abstract: Non-binary linear block codes (NB-LBCs) are an important class of error-correcting codes that are especially competent in correcting burst errors. They have broad applications in modern communications and storage systems. However, efficient soft-decision decoding of these codes remains challenging. This paper proposes successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding for NB-LBCs that are defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^r}, where r is the extension degree. By establishing a one-to-r mapping between the binary composition of each non-binary codeword and r binary polar codewords, SCL decoding of the r polar codes can be performed with a complexity that is sub-quadratic in the codeword length. An r-step decoding path sorting strategy is further proposed to facilitate the decoding. Simulation results on extended Reed-Solomon (eRS) and non-binary extended BCH (NB-eBCH) codes show that SCL decoding can outperform their state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding with fewer finite field arithmetic operations. For length-16 eRS codes, their maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performances can be approached with a moderate list size.
